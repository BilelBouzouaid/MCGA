    "\n",
    "**What if we could measure how environmentally friendly a chemical reaction was?**\n",

    "\n",
    "Before starting the project, we had to make several decisions about which green chemistry principles could realistically be evaluated. Some principles proved too time consuming or nearly impossible to assess, such as estimating the energy consumption of a reaction or determining whether renewable raw materials were used. These aspects were difficult to judge because we often lacked detailed information about the experimental conditions. In other cases, such as assessing the half-life of products to evaluate their environmental persistence, we simply could not find appropriate databases or reliable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge was finding the right reaction conditions, specifically the solvent or catalyst when the user did not provide them. To address this, we decided to use machine learning to predict these elements automatically. However, tools like ORDerly or the RXN Condition Selector were too complex for us to implement due to our limited experience, and we were unable to get them working.\n",
    "\n",
    "While integrating Gemini, one of the first issues we faced involved managing the API key. Initially, the key was hardcoded directly into the script. Recognizing the security risk, we later moved it to a hidden configuration file using Streamlit’s `secrets.toml` mechanism. This allowed us to access it securely using `st.secrets`, preventing the key from being exposed when pushing the code to public repositories like GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also encountered difficulties while trying to use the ECOTOX database to retrieve LD50 values. The dataset was massive; over 1 GB across 53 text files and parsing it proved more complicated than expected. Critical metrics like LD50 or BAF were inconsistently formatted and scattered across multiple files, making automation unreliable. Attempts to retrieve LD50 data directly from PubChem also failed. Ultimately, integrating toxicological data at scale required far more preprocessing and structure than we initially anticipated.\n"
