## üî• Usage

```python
from mypackage import main_func

# One line to rule them all
result = main_func(data)
```

This usage example shows how to quickly leverage the package's main functionality with just one line of code (or a few lines of code). 
After importing the `main_func` (to be renamed by you), you simply pass in your `data` and get the `result` (this is just an example, your package might have other inputs and outputs). 
Short and sweet, but the real power lies in the detailed documentation.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Installation

To initialize repo:
Create a new environment, you may also give the environment a different name. 

```
conda create -n mcga python=3.11
conda activate mcga
pip install -e .
```

To run the program:
```
cd MCGA/src/mcga
streamlit run app.py
```

# MCGA

A Python toolkit to score the greenness of chemical reactions by the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development installation

Initialize Git (only for the first time). 

Note: You should have create an empty repository on `https://github.com:jihokeum/mcga`.

```
git init
git add * 
git add .*
git commit -m "Initial commit" 
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:jihokeum/mcga.git 
git push -u origin main
```

Then add and commit changes as usual. 

To install the package, run

```
(mcga) $ pip install -e ".[test,doc]"
```

### Run tests and coverage

```
(conda_env) $ pip install tox
(conda_env) $ tox
```
